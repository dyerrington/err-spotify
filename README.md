# err-spotify

This is a plugin we've been devleoping on http://www.livecoding.tv.  For now, it only works on OSX (due to osascript communication), but hopefully many people will find it useful.  This is a first attempt at refactoring a few methods from a giant class, and is relatively untested.

###Requirements
* OSX
* Python 2+
* errbot
* Pandas (pip install pandas)

###Install
Clone this repo into your plugins directory, and that should be it.

###Config
Just edit the class properties.  Until I learn more about the errbot framework, this is all really hacked together.

###Updates
We may occasionally update this code together @
